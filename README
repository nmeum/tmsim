tmsim
=====

A fast turing machine simulator with graphviz export functionality.

Dependencies
============

The following software is required to build tmsim:

	- GNU make
	- C99 compiler (e.g. gcc)

Building
========

If you installed all dependencies build tmsim the following way:

	$ make

Format
======

The following EBNF describes valid tmsim input:

	turingmachine = metadata, states;
	metadata = "start:", statename, ";",
		"accept:", statenames, ";";

	statename = "q", digit, { digit };
	statenames = statename, { ",", statename };

	states = { state };
	state = statename, "{", [ transitions ], "}";

	transitions = transition, ";", { transition, ";" };
	transition = symbol, direction, symbol, "=>", statename;

	symbol = digit | letter | "$";
	direction = ">" | "|" | "<";

Besides a comment can be added anywhere in the tmsim input file.
Comments begin with the ASCII character '#' and end with a newline.

Documentation
=============

The entire code base is documented with comments that can be
parsed by Doxygen. A Doxyfile is not provided but if you are into that
sort of thing you can use Doxygen to generate some source code
documentation.
